# Complex Numbers Data Structure with Explicit Real Numbers Conversion

This project implements a simple data structure for complex numbers in C++. It includes the following features:

- Constructors for initializing complex numbers.
- Copy and move constructors.
- Explicit conversion from `RealNumber` to `ComplexNumber`.
- Operator overloading to allow conversion of `ComplexNumber` to `double`, representing the magnitude.

## Compilation

To compile the code, use a C++ compiler like `g++`:

```sh
g++ -o complex_number main.cpp
```
## Running
To run the compiled program:

```sh
./complex_number
```
